    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Department of Civil Engineering came into inception in the year 1984 providing Diploma in Civil Engineering. In the year 1999, the department also received the laurel of ISO-9004 certification along with the other departments of the institution. In 2003 the existing ISO systems were upgraded to new standards of ISO 9001:2000. In addition to above, the department got the NBA certification from the National Board of Accreditation under All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). Department also spear headed the process to get ISO 14000 accreditation for the institution.

        The department started B.Tech program in Civil Engineering with effect from 2009. The intake capacity in the Diploma programme is for 60 students. B.Tech has an intake of 30 students in the first year and with additional 30% seat in the second year for lateral entry of diploma students.
        
        The department has seven main well equipped labs viz Material Testing Lab, Survey Lab, Geotechnical Lab, Environmental Engineering Lab, Civil Computation Facility, Transportation Engineering Lab and Geology Lab.
        
        The department has been responsible for starting a green initiative to maintain green and clean campus by adopting environmental friendly practices such as:
        
        Effluent Treatment Plant to treat the night soil and sullage from quarters, hostels and academic buildings within the campus.
        Paper Recycling Plant to recycle the paper waste generated in the campus.
        Windrow Composting to convert the organic waste into useful manure which is used in the campus garden.
        Design and construction of mini gravity dam (BUND) across a perennial stream to recharge the ground water table and to augment the water supply in the campus
        Converting the existing academic block to a green building in association with IGBC.
